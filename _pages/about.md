In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, cooking, exploring national parks, and listening to podcasts. I love trying different pizza and noodle places around New York City!

For the 2016-2019 NBA seasons I was lucky enough to cover one of the greatest sports teams ever - the Golden State Warriors.
