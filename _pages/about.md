In my free time I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, cooking healthy meals, exploring national parks, and listening to Spotify non-stop. I love trying different pizza and noodle places around New York City!

For the 2016-2019 NBA seasons I've also been lucky enough to cover one of the greatest sports teams ever, the Golden State Warriors, as an NBA reporter for Titan Sports.
